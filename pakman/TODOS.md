- [ ]  check file for front matter; use more "efficient" way

e.g. do NOT load complete file; just a look-a-head;
try to make it work for binary file too? why? why not?
check how jekyll checks for front matter; does jekyll also
check binary files? does the file extension matter (e.g. png, gif, html, css, etc)??
