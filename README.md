## Filters

### `comments_percent_style` Filter

Strip comment lines starting with percent (that is, %). Example:

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Some Headers
    
    Title: Web Services REST-Style: Universal Identifiers, Formats & Protocols
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Some Extra CSS
    
    table { width: 100%; }
    table#restspeak th:nth-child(1) { width: 20%; }
    table#restspeak th:nth-child(2) { width: 5%; }

Becomes

    Title: Web Services REST-Style: Universal Identifiers, Formats & Protocols
    
    table { width: 100%; }
    table#restspeak th:nth-child(1) { width: 20%; }
    table#restspeak th:nth-child(2) { width: 5%; }

Also supports multiline comments with `%begin`|`comment`|`comments`/`%end` pairs. Example:

    %begin
    Using modern browser such as Firefox, Chrome and Safari you can
    now theme your slide shows using using "loss-free" vector graphics
    in plain old CSS. Thanks to gradient support in backgrounds in CSS3.
    %end

or

    %comment
    Using modern browser such as Firefox, Chrome and Safari you can
    now theme your slide shows using using "loss-free" vector graphics
    in plain old CSS. Thanks to gradient support in backgrounds in CSS3.
    %end

Note: As a shortcut using a single `%end` directive (that is, without a leading `%begin`)
will skip everything until the end of the document.


### `skip_end_directive` Filter

Skip (comment out) text blocks in your document by
enclosing with `__SKIP__`/`__END__`. Example:

    __SKIP__
    Using modern browser such as Firefox, Chrome and Safari you can
    now theme your slide shows using using "loss-free" vector graphics
    in plain old CSS. Thanks to gradient support in backgrounds in CSS3.
    __END__

Note: As a shortcut using just `__END__` (without `__SKIP__`)
will skip everything from `__END__` until the end of the document.
